requirePathErrorExample
=======================

To run this example just download the code run bower install.

If you don't have bower installed or don't really wish to install it just drop require js file in bower_components\requirejs\

When I run this example I see the module is loaded once but than it fails to load the second one.  I haven't investigate why this is happening or if this is the attended behavior. The error is somewhat cryptic so I want to post a solution to it.
